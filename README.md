# avatr2021

This is an artwork inspired by MOLOCH and has a characterstics of robot. I have also included multiple features and traits (weapons, wings, etc). 

The colour of avatar can be modified to any extend as per our liking. 

Note : Body Traits , Weapons and even facial features can be further modified.
